Fiat Automobiles S.p.A. ('Italian Automobiles Factory of Turin') is an Italian automobile manufacturer,
formerly part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and since 2021 a subsidiary of Stellantis through its Italian
division Stellantis Italy. Fiat Automobiles was formed in January 2007 when Fiat S.p.A. reorganized its automobile
business, and traces its history back to 1899 when the first Fiat automobile, the Fiat 4 HP, was produced.

it remained the largest automobile manufacturer in Europe and the third in the world after General Motors and
Ford for over 20 years, until the car industry crisis in the late 1980s. In 2013, Fiat S.p.A. was the second
largest European automaker by volumes produced and the seventh in the world, while FCA was the world's eighth-largest
